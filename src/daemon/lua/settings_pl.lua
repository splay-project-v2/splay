--[[ NOTES ABOUT LIMITATIONS

The network.max_send and network.max_receive settings don't directly limit your
bandwith.  They only avoid a job to do something weird. But when a job finish,
it can be quickly replaced by a new one. And each one will have again the same
limitations. So, jobs can use a lot of bandwith if their lifetime is short.

The true way to protect you is using an external bandwith management (QoS) like
'trickle' on unixes that permit you to set limits. Then, put the speed
limitations you have choosed in network.send_speed and network.receive_speed.

CPU limitations are not enforced by splayd, but you can give a low priority to
the process using the 'nice' command.

    \section{Motivations}

      The process of learning distributed systems and algorithms is usually
      undermined by the difficulty of being able for one to test and apply
      what he learns.\\
      Indeed, in order to run a distributed algorithm and observe the result, a
      collection of machines running the algorithm is needed. Besides that,
      one would like to be able to change the conditions in which the algorithm
      is run, for example by provoking faulty nodes, or inducing network
      perturbations among the system, as distributed algorithms are designed to
      adapt to these conditions. These needs make it really cumbersome
      for students to setup a testing environment emulating realistic
      conditions for learning purposes.\\

      The motivation of the Splay Project is to solve this issue by providing
      professors and students with a whole platform
